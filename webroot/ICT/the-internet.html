		<h1>The Internet</h1>
<p>The <em>internet</em> is a giant network of computers around the world that connect to each other.
Anyone can connect their computer or mobile phone to the internet.</p>
<p>Uses of the internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>News</li>
<li>Learning facts, for example from Wikipedia</li>
<li>Chatting to people - Often on social media sites like Facebook</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
<li>Software applications. Software can be installed on your computer, or it can be run online over the internet.</li>
<li>Watching videos</li>
<li>Playing online games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Websites, Webpages, and Links</h2>
<p>The internet is made up of <em>websites</em>. Each website is made up of many <em>webpages</em>.</p>
<p>The internet is like a giant library. The websites are like books. The webpages are like pages in a book.</p>
<p>Unlike paper pages, webpages can be linked together. If you click on a link in one webpage, it takes you to a different webpage - which can be on a different website.</p>
<p>These links are like threads joining webpages and websites, a bit like threads in a &quot;spider's web&quot;. This is why the internet is also called &quot;the world wide web&quot;.</p>
<p>Links often looks like this: <u><font color="blue">an underlined bit in a different colour</font></u>.</p>
<h2>URLs: online addresses</h2>
<p>Each webpage has an address, called a URL (uniform resource location).
This is very different from a physical address!</p>
<p>Sometimes people call the URL a &quot;link&quot;, because they are similar. A link puts a URL into a webpage or a message, so that people can click and go to the URL.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><code>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv22k054z5zo</code></p>
<p>This has 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The protocol. E.g. <code><strong><u>https://</u></strong></code><br />
This is a technical instruction for the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The website. E.g. <code>https://<strong><u>www.bbc.com</u></strong></code><br />
You read the website from right to left: &quot;bbc.com&quot; is the <em>domain</em> which identifies the company, then &quot;www&quot; is the sub-domain for a website run by this company. The sub-domain can be anything the company chooses. &quot;www&quot;, short for &quot;world-wide-web&quot;, is a common sub-domain.</p>
<p>Check the domain to see if you trust the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The webpage. E.g. <code>https://www.bbc.com/<strong><u>news/articles/cv22k054z5zo?utm=167</u></strong></code><br />
The rest of the address is the specific webpage within the website. It often uses arbitrary identifiers which don't mean much to us, but make sense to the website computers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Warning: Sometimes criminals will use a domain that looks similar to a proper company. For example, &quot;amazn.com&quot; (fake!) or &quot;amazon.tanzania-department.com&quot; (fake!) instead of &quot;amazon.com&quot; (proper).</p>
<h2>Browsers</h2>
<p>To use the internet, you use a software application called a <em>browser</em>.</p>
<p>You enter a URL or some search words into the browser.</p>
<p>Some common browsers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FireFox</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
<li>Apple Safari</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, social media apps often have a limited internet-browser built in.</p>
<p>Other software applications can also use the internet in specialised ways. For example, computer games can use the internet to let people play against each other.</p>
<h2>Search Engines</h2>
<p>The internet is massive -- there are billions of websites!</p>
<p>People use <em>search engines</em> to find what they want.</p>
<p>A couple of popular search engines are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://google.com">Google</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bing.com">Microsoft Bing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To use a search engine, you type in some words for the thing you want.</p>
<p>Browsers can automatically connect to a search engine, so you can type your search words into the browser when you start.</p>
<p>Many websites also have a search for that website. For example, shopping websites let you search their catalogue for the product you want.</p>
<h2>Warning: Incorrect facts, Fake news, Trolls, and Criminals!</h2>
<p><em>Anyone</em> can publish on the internet.</p>
<p>The advantage of this is that it has allowed lots of people to share knowledge and be creative.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that some people are not to be trusted, and some people are not well informed.</p>
<p>Beware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incorrect facts: Anyone can write anything, and most web-pages are not checked. People make mistakes, so web-pages can contain mistakes and bad information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake news: Some people deliberately want to deceive you with propaganda. They can make news stories which can look real - even with photos and videos. You can make a fake video showing a real person saying something they never said.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are fake videos of famous people doing sexual acts. Do not believe these.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trolls: Most people are nice, but some people enjoy being unpleasant and starting arguments online. They are called <em>trolls</em>. It is best to ignore them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criminals: Most people are honest, but some people are criminal. Online criminals may try to steal your online accounts, or get your money in a scam, like selling tickets they don't have.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to trust?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look at the domain: Do you trust this company?
<ul>
<li>For example, big news companies like the BBC, CNN, or Al Jazeera work with reliable journalists, and check their facts. These sites can be trusted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wikipedia: This is an excellent site for facts. Anyone can edit it, but the edits get checked. So it can normally be trusted.</li>
<li>Blogs: Anyone can make a blog, so look at the person making it.
<ul>
<li>Check some of the claims they make. Do they give links to reliable sites? If not, be careful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social media sites like Facebook, Tik-Tok, and YouTube allow anyone to publish. So the content cannot be trusted unless you trust the person posting. Look at the person or the channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be especially careful with health / medical advice, and money / business advice.</p>
