		<h1>Introduction to Computers</h1>
<p>Computers are mart machines. They were invented in World War 2 to help crack enemy codes.
Since then they have become a key part of everyday life. Using computers well is essential for many jobs.
Computers can also be used to stay in touch with family and friends who are distant, and for fun, like playing games or watching videos.</p>
<p>This lesson teaches you about computers, how they work, and how to use them. It covers the most important basics, which give you building blocks for more advanced lessons.</p>
<h2>Types of Computer</h2>
<ol>
<li>Desktop computer - Good for offices.</li>
<li>Laptop computer - Portable and good for travel.</li>
<li>Mobile phone - Often not thought of as a computer, but they are.</li>
<li>Tablet computer - Like a large mobile phone. Good for reading, drawing, and casual apps.</li>
<li>Server - A powerful computer for storing data and running websites. Kept in special data-center buildings.</li>
<li>Embedded computer - Small computers inside other devices, like a washing machine or a car.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Parts of a Desktop Computer</h2>
<p>Hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU - Central Processing Unit. This is the brain of the computer.</li>
<li>GPU - Graphics Processing Unit. This is used for high-powered computer games, and also for AI.</li>
<li>Memory - This is where the computer temporarily holds data while it is working. The main type of memory is RAM (random access memory).</li>
<li>Hard drive or SSD - This is where the computer stores data permanently. An SSD (solid state drive) is faster than a hard drive. SSDs are similar to flash memory.</li>
<li>Motherboard - This is the main circuit board of the computer. It connects all the parts together.</li>
<li>Keyboard</li>
<li>Mouse (or trackpad on a laptop)</li>
<li>Monitor - The computer screen, where you see what the computer is doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software (also called <em>code</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system (OS) - The software that runs the computer. Examples are Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux.</li>
<li>Applications - Programs that you run on the computer, like a word-processor or a web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files (also called <em>documents</em>): These are the things you create and save on the computer. They can be text, images, music, or anything else.</li>
<li>Folders: These are like digital filing cabinets. They help you organize your files.</li>
<li>Internet and mobile data: The computer can exchange data with other computers over the internet. This is how online apps handle data.</li>
<li>Cloud storage: When you save your files on the internet, so you can access them from other computers, and share them with other people.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardware is like the body of the computer, and the software is like the mind. Data is the knowledge.</p>
<h2>How Computers Work</h2>
<p>A lot of computer use follows this pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load an application, e.g. a word-processor.</li>
<li>Input - You give the computer information, like typing on a keyboard or clicking a mouse.</li>
<li>Processing - The computer thinks about what you told it to do.</li>
<li>Output - The computer shows you the result, usually on screen.</li>
<li>...Repeat 2, 3, 4...</li>
<li>Storage - The computer saves data for later use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Computers can talk to each other over the internet.</p>
<h3>Common Inputs</h3>
<p>These patterns of input are used in lots of applications. That makes them rally useful. Try them out in a word-processor so you can learn them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mouse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left click: Select or open.</li>
<li>Right click: Open a menu for more options.</li>
<li>Hold left click: Drag and drop, e.g. to move a file.</li>
<li>Wheel: Scroll up and down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keyboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letters, numbers, and symbols: Type text.</li>
<li>Enter: Confirm a choice.</li>
<li>Shift or ⇧: Type a capital letter, or type the &quot;upper&quot; character on a key. E.g. Shift + a types &quot;A&quot;, Shift + 1 types &quot;!&quot;
<ul>
<li>The Shift key on its own does nothing. So to type a capital letter you can hold down shift then tap the letter key. That's easier than trying to tap them both at exactly the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The arrow keys, also called cursor keys: Move the cursor around. The cursor is the place where your typing goes. Also used in computer games!</li>
<li>Esc (short for Escape): Closes a menu, or cancel an action. Escape is useful for getting back to the normal input mode.</li>
<li>Backspace or ⇐: Deletes the character to the left of the cursor (which is usually the character just typed).</li>
<li>Del or Delete: Deletes the character to the right of the cursor, or deletes the selected file or object.</li>
<li>Ctrl (short for Control): Used as a fast way to do common actions.
<ul>
<li>Ctrl + C copies text or files</li>
<li>Ctrl + V pastes what you copied</li>
<li>Ctrl + X cuts text or files -- this is like Ctrl+C copy, but it will also delete the original when you then paste.</li>
<li>Ctrl + Z undoes the last action. Useful when you make a mistake.</li>
<li>Ctrl + S saves your work. You should do this often!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>F (function) keys: a row of special keys at the top of the keyboard. They do different things depending on the program you're using.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Touchscreen (on mobile phones and tablets):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap: Select or open, like left-click on a mouse.</li>
<li>Swipe: Move the screen up, down, left, or right.</li>
<li>Pinch (place two fingers on the screen and move them together or apart): Zoom in or out.</li>
<li>Hold: Opens a menu or gives more options, like right-click on a mouse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
