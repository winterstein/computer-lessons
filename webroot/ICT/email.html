		<h1>Email</h1>
<p><em>Email</em> is a system for sending messages from computer to computer. You can also use email on mobile phones with an email app.</p>
<p>Email is provided by email companies. There are lots of these companies. Some common ones are google.com (also called gmail.com), outlook.com, and yahoo.com.</p>
<h2>Using Email</h2>
<p>A physical letter has an envelope with the address, and then the letter inside.</p>
<p>An email has:</p>
<pre><code>To: The email address for the person who receives the email.   
CC: Optional extra addresses to copy the email to.   
From: The email address for the person sending the email.   
Subject: A title for the message -- this is the first thing the recipient sees before they open the email.   
The body
</code></pre>
<p>The body of the email is the letter. Like a physical letter, you normally start by writing &quot;Dear {their-name}&quot; and finish by signing off, e.g. &quot;Kind regards, {your-name}&quot;.</p>
<p>You can send files and documents by attaching them to an email (look for a paperclip icon ðŸ“Ž in your email app).
You can also send links by email.</p>
<h2>Email Address</h2>
<p>An email address is created by an email company. It has two parts, separated by an <code>@</code>. These are the account-name for the person, and the website domain for the email company. For example, <code>david2024@outlook.com</code>, where <code>david2024</code> is the account-name, and <code>outlook.com</code> is the website domain.</p>
<p>There can also be a name label. This is set by the person sending the email -- and they can set any name they like (including a fake name).</p>
<h2>Spam and Criminal Email</h2>
<p>Most people are honest and good. However there are some criminals online. Computers allow even a few criminals to cause a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>If a criminal had to send hand-written letters -- each letter would take time, and would cost a stamp.
With a computer, a criminal can send a million emails a day, and it costs almost nothing.</p>
<p>When you use the internet, the websites and apps collect data about you, such as your name.
Sometimes criminals steal this data. So a criminal may know your name, and even your birthday and where you live.
They can use this to make deceptive spam emails.</p>
<h3>Spam Filters</h3>
<p>Email applications have safety systems against spam, called <em>spam filters</em>. The spam filter checks your email and tries to detect
spam. If it thinks an email is spam, then it puts it into a &quot;spam&quot; folder, and deletes it after a while.</p>
<p>Spam filters catch and remove a lot of spam. But they are not perfect. Criminals are always coming up with new ways to write spam, which can get past the spam filter. Also spam filters sometimes wrongly tag a valid email as spam. If you expected an email and it has not arrived -- check the spam folder. It may have been mistakenly tagged as spam.</p>
