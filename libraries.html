		<h1>Libraries</h1>
<p>A <em>library</em> is a building for the community to share books, and often also movie DVDs. Many libraries provide other free services for the community, such as newspapers, free wi-fi for internet access, or a computer lab.</p>
<p>You can visit a library to read books there and use their computers.</p>
<p>You can also borrow books from a library for free, and take them home to read. To borrow a book you must be a member of the library. You borrow the book for 1 or 2 weeks. There is usually a fine if you return it late.</p>
<p>Libraries can be big or small. From the Cambridge University Library, which is a vast building with millions of books, to small &quot;box libraries&quot; run by local people with just a dozen books.</p>
<p>Many schools have a library so that students can read more. If your school does not, you could ask the head-master if they would consider starting one.</p>
