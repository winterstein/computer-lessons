# Libraries

A *library* is a building for the community to share books, and often also movie DVDs. Many libraries provide other free services for the community, such as newspapers, free wi-fi for internet access, or a computer lab.

You can visit a library to read books there and use their computers.

You can also borrow books from a library for free, and take them home to read. To borrow a book you must be a member of the library. You borrow the book for 1 or 2 weeks. There is usually a fine if you return it late.

Libraries can be big or small. From the Cambridge University Library, which is a vast building with millions of books, to small "box libraries" run by local people with just a dozen books.

Many schools have a library so that students can read more. If your school does not, you could ask the head-master if they would consider starting one.
