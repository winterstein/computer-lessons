# Word Processors

A *word processor* is a software application for writing letters and other written documents. 

Some word-processors are: Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, and Google Docs.

You can print the document to get a physical copy. Or you can use the digital file, for example sending it by email.

Word processors have several features to help you make nice documents:

- **Fonts**   
A font is the style of letters. You can change the style, the size, and the colour of the text.
Here are some examples: `a monospaced font`, <span style="font-family:script">a script (hand-writing style) font</font>, <small>small text</small>, <span style="color:green">green text</span>. 

- **Spell-checking**   
A spell-checker uses a dictionary to check the words you write. It can spot spelling mistakes and help you to correct them.
Many applications have *auto-correct* spell-checking, where the computer automatically fixes a word if it thinks it was a spelling mistake.
Spell-checking is useful but it is not always right, especially when writing people's names, since these are not in the dictionary.


## Try an example: A Job Application Letter

This document is a draft letter asking for a job.

Try editing it to put in your name, and some information about your skills.

Maybe ask your teacher for feedback on your letter.

## Try an example: An Event Poster

This document is a poster for a school event.

Try changing the fonts, and moving images around.

A word-processor is not the best choice of software application for making a poster, as the graphics editing is limited. It is not a bad choice either. -->
