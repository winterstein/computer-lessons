# Word Processors

A *word processor* is a software application for writing letters and other written documents. 

Some word-processors are: Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, and Google Docs.

You can print the document to get a paper copy. Or you can use the digital file, for example sending it by email.

<style>
.blink {
	animation: blink 1.5s steps(1, end) infinite;
}  
@keyframes blink {
0% {
	opacity: 1;
}
50% {
	opacity: 0;
}
100% {
	opacity: 1;
}
}
</style>

When you open the word processor, look for the **cursor**. It is a blinking line, like this: <span class="blink">|</span>. When you type on the keyboard, the letters appear where the cursor is - and the cursor moves forward as you type. 

To move the cursor to a different place in the document, use the arrow keys or the mouse + a click.

To remove letters, there are two keys: *Backspace* or <span class="large">‚áê</span> removes letters to the left of the cursor (what you just typed). 
*Delete* or *Del* removes letters to the right.

Word processors have several features to help you make nice documents:

- **Fonts**   
A font is the style of letters. You can change the style, the size, and the colour of the text.
Here are some examples: `a monospaced font`, <span style="font-family:script">a script (hand-writing style) font</span>, <span style="font-size:60%">small text</span>, or <span style="color:green">green text</span>. 

- **Spell-checking**   
A spell-checker uses a dictionary to check the words you write. It can spot spelling mistakes and help you to correct them.
Many applications have *auto-correct* spell-checking, where the computer automatically fixes a word if it thinks it was a spelling mistake.
Spell-checking is useful but it is not always right, especially when writing people's names, since these are not in the dictionary.

## Try an example: An Event Poster

This document is a poster for a school event.

Try changing the fonts, and moving images around.

A word-processor is not the best choice of software application for making a poster, as the graphics editing is limited. It is not a bad choice either. -->
