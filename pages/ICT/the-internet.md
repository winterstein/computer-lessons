# The Internet

The *internet* is a giant network of computers around the world that connect to each other.
Anyone can connect their computer or mobile phone to the internet.

Uses of the internet:

 - Reading news
 - Learning facts, for example from Wikipedia
 - Chatting to people - Often on social media sites like Facebook
 - Shopping
 - Software applications. Software can be installed on your computer, or it can be run online over the internet.
 - Watching videos
 - Playing online games

## Websites, Webpages, and Links

The internet is made up of *websites*. Each website is made up of many *webpages*.

The internet is like a giant library. The websites are like books. The webpages are like pages in a book.

Unlike paper pages, webpages can be linked together. If you click on a link in one webpage, it takes you to a different webpage - which can be on a different website.

These links are like threads joining webpages and websites, a bit like threads in a "spider's web". This is why the internet is also called "the world wide web".

Links often looks like this: <u><font color="blue">an underlined bit in a different colour</font></u>.

## URLs: online addresses

Each webpage has an address, called a URL (uniform resource location).
This is very different from a physical address!

Sometimes people call the URL a "link", because they are similar. A link puts a URL into a webpage or a message, so that people can click and go to the URL.

Here is an example:

`https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv22k054z5zo`

This has 3 parts:

1. The protocol. E.g. <code>**<u>https://</u>**</code>   
   This is a technical instruction for the browser. 

2. The website. E.g. <code>https://**<u>www.bbc.com</u>**</code>   
	You read the website from right to left: "bbc.com" is the *domain* which identifies the company, then "www" is the sub-domain for a website run by this company. The sub-domain can be anything the company chooses. "www", short for "world-wide-web", is a common sub-domain.

	Check the domain to see if you trust the company.

3. The webpage. E.g. <code>https://www.bbc.com/**<u>news/articles/cv22k054z5zo?utm=167</u>**</code>   
   The rest of the address is the specific webpage within the website. It often uses arbitrary identifiers which don't mean much to us, but make sense to the website computers.  

Warning: Sometimes criminals will use a domain that looks similar to a proper company. For example, "amazn.com" (fake!) or "amazon.tanzania-department.com" (fake!) instead of "amazon.com" (proper).

## Browsers

To use the internet, you use a software application called a *browser*.

You enter a URL or some search words into the browser.

Some common browsers are:

- FireFox
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Apple Safari

Also, social media apps often have a limited internet-browser built in.

Other software applications can also use the internet in specialised ways. For example, computer games can use the internet to let people play against each other. 


## Search Engines

The internet is massive -- there are billions of websites!

People use *search engines* to find what they want.

A couple of popular search engines are:

 - [Google](https://google.com)
 - [Microsoft Bing](https://bing.com)
 - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)
  
To use a search engine, you type in some words for the thing you want.

Browsers can automatically connect to a search engine, so you can type your search words into the browser when you start.

Many websites also have a search for that website. For example, shopping websites let you search their catalogue for the product you want. 

## Warning: Incorrect facts, Fake news, Trolls, and Criminals!

*Anyone* can publish on the internet.

The advantage of this is that it has allowed lots of people to share knowledge and be creative.

The disadvantage is that some people are not to be trusted, and some people are not well informed.

Beware of:

- Incorrect facts: Anyone can write anything, and most web-pages are not checked. People make mistakes, so web-pages can contain mistakes and bad information. 

- Fake news: Some people deliberately want to deceive you with propaganda. They can make news stories which can look real - even with photos and videos. You can make a fake video showing a real person saying something they never said.
  - There are fake videos of famous people doing sexual acts. Do not believe these.

- Trolls: Most people are nice, but some people enjoy being unpleasant and starting arguments online. They are called *trolls*. It is best to ignore them.

- Criminals: Most people are honest, but some people are criminal. Online criminals may try to steal your online accounts, or get your money in a scam, like selling tickets they don't have.

## What to trust?

 - Look at the domain: Do you trust this company?
   - For example, big news companies like the BBC, CNN, or Al Jazeera work with reliable journalists, and check their facts. These sites can be trusted.
 - Wikipedia: This is an excellent site for facts. Anyone can edit it, but the edits get checked. So it can normally be trusted.
 - Blogs: Anyone can make a blog, so look at the person making it.
   - Check some of the claims they make. Do they give links to reliable sites? If not, be careful.
 - Social media sites like Facebook, Tik-Tok, and YouTube allow anyone to publish. So the content cannot be trusted unless you trust the person posting. Look at the person or the channel.

Be especially careful with health / medical advice, and money / business advice.
