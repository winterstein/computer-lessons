# Online Safety

The internet is a powerful tool for learning, for doing business, and for meeting people. It has many benefits ...and some dangers.

## Types of Criminal Scam

Phishing - getting your account details, usually to steal money or buy things at your expense.
These criminals often send an email pretending to be a real company -- such as a bank or a delivery company. They ask you to provide your account details and password. They can make websites that look just like the real bank's website -- only the website domain will be different.

Computer viruses: Software that harms your computer. Often a computer virus will take over your email, and send false messages to your friends to spread the virus. Be careful what software you run.

Ransomware: A type of computer virus that locks your computer, and you have to pay a ransom to the criminals to unlock it.

There is anti-virus software to help detect viruses.

Love scams (also called cat-fishing): These criminals pretend to be a nice man or woman looking for love. They may ask for money. Or they may ask the victim to share a naked photo of themselves. The photo is then used to blackmail the victim for money.

Of course many real people use the internet to find love. 


## Warning: Incorrect facts, Fake news, Trolls, and Criminals!

*Anyone* can publish on the internet.

The advantage of this is that it has allowed lots of people to share knowledge and be creative.

The disadvantage is that some people are not to be trusted, and some people are not well informed.

Beware of:

- Incorrect facts: Anyone can write anything, and most web-pages are not checked. People make mistakes, so web-pages can contain mistakes and bad information. 

- Fake news: Some people deliberately want to deceive you with propaganda. They can make news stories which can look real - even with photos and videos. You can make a fake video showing a real person saying something they never said.
  - There are fake videos of famous people doing sexual acts. Do not believe these.

- Trolls: Most people are nice, but some people enjoy being unpleasant and starting arguments online. They are called *trolls*. It is best to ignore them.

- Criminals: Most people are honest, but some people are criminal. Online criminals may try to steal your online accounts, or get your money in a scam, like selling tickets they don't have.

## What to trust?

 - Look at the domain: Do you trust this company?
 - Social media sites like Facebook, Tik-Tok, and YouTube allow anyone to publish. So the content cannot be trusted unless you trust the person posting. Look at the person or the channel.
 - Remember: Anyone can make a website, and can pretend to be who they like. The website domain is the only part that is regulated.

Be especially careful with health / medical advice, and money / business advice.

### How to check the Website Domain

The website domain (e.g. `bbc.com`) is the only part of a website that is regulated. It tells you what company makes the website. It cannot be faked, but criminals can use a sneaky domain name to confuse you.

*In a web browser:* Look at the url. E.g. in this url, `https://www.bbc.com/blah/blah` the domain is `bbc.com`.
The website domain is after the `//` and before the next `/`. It is the 2 or 3 parts on the right -- parts on the left (like `www`) are sub-domains, which are controlled by the domain-owner and don't mean much.

Here are some examples of dodgy domains where a criminal is pretending to be amazon.com (a big online-shopping company) to trick you:

`https://amazon.com.shopping632.ru` <-- The left part looks good, but that's the sub-domain (which the criminal can set as they wish). The right part "shopping632.ru" is the domain, and that is not a proper company.

`https://amazon-delivery-tz.com` <-- It sounds like amazon.com, but it's not.

*In email:* Look at the email address. E.g. in this email `delivery@amazon.com` the domain is `amazon.com`.

Again: watch out for deliberately confusing domains, like misspelled words (e.g. "delivery@amazzn.tz"), or using sub-domains (e.g. "delivery@amazon.com.shopping632.ru").

*In social media:* You often cannot check the domain - so be extra careful.
