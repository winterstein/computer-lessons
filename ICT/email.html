		<h1>Email</h1>
<p><em>Email</em> is a system for sending messages from computer to computer. You can also use email on mobile phones with an email app.</p>
<p>Email is provided by email companies. There are lots of these companies. Some common ones are google.com (also called gmail.com), outlook.com, and yahoo.com.</p>
<h2>Using Email</h2>
<p>A physical letter has an envelope with the address, and then the letter inside.</p>
<p>An email has:</p>
<pre><code>*To*: The email address for the person who receives the email.   
*CC*: Optional extra addresses to copy the email to.   
*From*: The email address for the person sending the email.   
*Subject*: A title for the message -- this is the first thing the recipient sees before they open the email.   
*The body*: The body of the email is the letter. Like a physical letter, you normally start by writing &quot;Dear {their-name}&quot; and finish by signing off, e.g. &quot;Kind regards, {your-name}&quot;.
*Attachments&quot;: Files and documents that get sent with the email. This is a good way to share files. Look for a paperclip icon ðŸ“Ž in your email app to attach a file. You can also send links by email -- you can do this by putting a url in the body text.
</code></pre>
<h2>Email Address</h2>
<p>An email address is created by an email company. It has two parts, separated by an <code>@</code>. These are the account-name for the person, and the website domain for the email company. For example, <code>david2024@outlook.com</code>, where <code>david2024</code> is the account-name, and <code>outlook.com</code> is the website domain.</p>
<p>There can also be a name label. This is set by the person sending the email -- and they can set any name they like (including a fake name).</p>
<h2>Spam and Criminal Email</h2>
<p>Most people are honest and good. However there are some criminals online. Computers allow even a few criminals to cause a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Criminals can send emails to trick you out of money. There are a few tricks they use. They can persuade people to send them money with scams like fake government fines or fake delivery fees. Or they can get your login details and passwords, so they can access your accounts and spend your money. Using tricks to get your login details is called <em>phishing</em>, similar to &quot;fishing&quot;. Phishing starts with a fake email, and then a fake website that looks like a real website. If you are suspicious, then carefully check the website domain in the address bar to see if it is the real website.</p>
<p>If a criminal had to send hand-written letters -- each letter would take time, and would cost a stamp.
With a computer, a criminal can send a million emails a day, and it costs almost nothing.</p>
<p>When you use the internet, the websites and apps collect data about you, such as your name.
Sometimes criminals steal this data. So a criminal may know your name, and even your birthday and where you live.
They can use this to make deceptive spam emails.</p>
<p>See <a href="safe-online.html">Safety Online</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Spam Filters</h3>
<p>Email applications have safety systems against spam, called <em>spam filters</em>. The spam filter checks your email and tries to detect
spam. If it thinks an email is spam, then it puts it into a &quot;spam&quot; folder, and deletes it after a while.</p>
<p>Spam filters catch and remove a lot of spam. But they are not perfect. Criminals are always coming up with new ways to write spam, which can get past the spam filter. Also spam filters sometimes wrongly tag a valid email as spam. If you expected an email and it has not arrived -- check the spam folder. It may have been mistakenly tagged as spam.</p>
