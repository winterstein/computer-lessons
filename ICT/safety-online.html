		<h1>Online Safety</h1>
<p>The internet is a powerful tool for learning, for doing business, and for meeting people. It has many benefits ...and some dangers.</p>
<h2>Types of Criminal Scam</h2>
<p>Phishing - getting your account details, usually to steal money or buy things at your expense.
These criminals often send an email pretending to be a real company -- such as a bank or a delivery company. They ask you to provide your account details and password. They can make websites that look just like the real bank's website -- only the website domain will be different.</p>
<p>Computer viruses: Software that harms your computer. Often a computer virus will take over your email, and send false messages to your friends to spread the virus. Be careful what software you run.</p>
<p>Ransomware: A type of computer virus that locks your computer, and you have to pay a ransom to the criminals to unlock it.</p>
<p>There is anti-virus software to help detect viruses.</p>
<p>Love scams (also called cat-fishing): These criminals pretend to be a nice man or woman looking for love. They may ask for money. Or they may ask the victim to share a naked photo of themselves. The photo is then used to blackmail the victim for money.</p>
<p>Of course many real people use the internet to find love.</p>
<h2>Warning: Incorrect facts, Fake news, Trolls, and Criminals!</h2>
<p><em>Anyone</em> can publish on the internet.</p>
<p>The advantage of this is that it has allowed lots of people to share knowledge and be creative.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that some people are not to be trusted, and some people are not well informed.</p>
<p>Beware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incorrect facts: Anyone can write anything, and most web-pages are not checked. People make mistakes, so web-pages can contain mistakes and bad information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake news: Some people deliberately want to deceive you with propaganda. They can make news stories which can look real - even with photos and videos. You can make a fake video showing a real person saying something they never said.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are fake videos of famous people doing sexual acts. Do not believe these.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trolls: Most people are nice, but some people enjoy being unpleasant and starting arguments online. They are called <em>trolls</em>. It is best to ignore them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criminals: Most people are honest, but some people are criminal. Online criminals may try to steal your online accounts, or get your money in a scam, like selling tickets they don't have.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to trust?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look at the domain: Do you trust this company?</li>
<li>Social media sites like Facebook, Tik-Tok, and YouTube allow anyone to publish. So the content cannot be trusted unless you trust the person posting. Look at the person or the channel.</li>
<li>Remember: Anyone can make a website, and can pretend to be who they like. The website domain is the only part that is regulated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be especially careful with health / medical advice, and money / business advice.</p>
<h3>How to check the Website Domain</h3>
<p>The website domain (e.g. <code>bbc.com</code>) is the only part of a website that is regulated. It tells you what company makes the website. It cannot be faked, but criminals can use a sneaky domain name to confuse you.</p>
<p><em>In a web browser:</em> Look at the url. E.g. in this url, <code>https://www.bbc.com/blah/blah</code> the domain is <code>bbc.com</code>.
The website domain is after the <code>//</code> and before the next <code>/</code>. It is the 2 or 3 parts on the right -- parts on the left (like <code>www</code>) are sub-domains, which are controlled by the domain-owner and don't mean much.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of dodgy domains where a criminal is pretending to be amazon.com (a big online-shopping company) to trick you:</p>
<p><code>https://amazon.com.shopping632.ru</code> &lt;-- The left part looks good, but that's the sub-domain (which the criminal can set as they wish). The right part &quot;shopping632.ru&quot; is the domain, and that is not a proper company.</p>
<p><code>https://amazon-delivery-tz.com</code> &lt;-- It sounds like amazon.com, but it's not.</p>
<p><em>In email:</em> Look at the email address. E.g. in this email <code>delivery@amazon.com</code> the domain is <code>amazon.com</code>.</p>
<p>Again: watch out for deliberately confusing domains, like misspelled words (e.g. &quot;delivery@amazzn.tz&quot;), or using sub-domains (e.g. &quot;delivery@amazon.com.shopping632.ru&quot;).</p>
<p><em>In social media:</em> You often cannot check the domain - so be extra careful.</p>
